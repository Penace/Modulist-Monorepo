# Modulist â€“ Backend

## Overview

This is the official backend for the Modulist platform.  
It now uses a modular Express + MongoDB architecture with full support for:

- Listings and pending approvals
- User registration and moderation
- Settings management and middleware auth checks
- RESTful API integration
- Admin tools and seed scripts
- Production-grade modularity and scalability

Previously started with `json-server` for prototyping.  
Now fully transitioned to production-ready Node.js backend.
